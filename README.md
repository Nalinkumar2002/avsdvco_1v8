# Introduction 

A VCO is the heart of the PLL and can be designed either by LC or RC. A LC VCOs have superior phase noise performance compared with ring VCO’S. However, an LC VCO has a small tuning range, large layout area and possibly higher power. The ring oscillators, however, do not have the complication of the on-chip inductors required for the LC oscillators. Thus the chip area is reduced and have a wide tuning range; ring oscillators with even number of delay cells can produce quadrature-phase outputs.
"Current-Starved" means that the current through the circuit is indeed limited. Lowering Vn and increasing Vp increases the effective drive resistance R<sub>eq</sub> of the inverter and thus increases the delay.The current in the first NMOS and PMOS are mirrored in each inverter/current source stage.Further tuning of oscillation frequency is done by adjusting the value of ID by changing size of bias stage transistors. Two buffer inverters are additionally used after inverter stages for preventing output loading (A
large capacitive load may affect the F<sub>osc</sub> and K<sub>vco</sub> ).

# Open Source Tools Used

 🌟 eSim
 
   * eSim (previously known as Oscad / FreeEDA) is a free/libre and open source EDA tool for circuit design, simulation, analysis and PCB design. It is an integrated tool built    using free/libre and open source software such as KiCad, Ngspice and GHDL. eSim is released under GPL.It can serve as an alternative to commercially available/licensed software tools like OrCAD, Xpedition and HSPICE.

        🔗 https://esim.fossee.in/home
 
 🌟 Ngspice
 
   * Ngspice is a mixed-level/mixed-signal electronic circuit simulator.
   * Ngspice is based on three open-source free-software packages: 
      * Spice3f5
      * Xspice
      * Cider1b1
   
      🔗 http://ngspice.sourceforge.net/
        
 🌟 Sky130 PDK
 
   * The SKY130 is a mature 180nm-130nm hybrid technology originally developed internally by Cypress Semiconductor before being spun out into SkyWater Technology and made accessible to general industry. SkyWater and Google’s collaboration is now making this technology accessible to everyone.
   * The SKY130 Process Node is an extremely flexible offering, including many normally optional features as standard (features like the local interconnect, SONOS functionality, MiM capacitors, and more). This provides the designer with a wide range of flexibility in design choices.
   
     🔗 https://github.com/google/skywater-pdk
   
 🌟 Magic
 
  * Magic is a venerable VLSI layout tool, written in the 1980's at Berkeley by John Ousterhout, now famous primarily for writing the scripting interpreter language Tcl. Due largely in part to its liberal Berkeley open-source license, magic has remained popular with universities and small companies.
  * The open-source license has allowed VLSI engineers with a bent toward programming to implement clever ideas and help magic stay abreast of fabrication technology. However, it is the well thought-out core algorithms which lend to magic the greatest part of its popularity.
  * Magic is widely cited as being the easiest tool to use for circuit layout, even for people who ultimately rely on commercial tools for their product design flow.

 🏷️   Maximum frequency of VCO achieved for post-layout simulations `F_OUT = 1.75 GHz` @ vctrl= 1.6 V
 
 🏷️   VCO frequency increases (F_OUT) when control voltage (VCTRL) is being increased for both pre-layout and post-layout simulations.

 🏷️   Vco output frequency (F_OUT) increases when Bias voltage (VDD) is being increased for both pre-layout and post-layout simulations.
 
 🏷️   During pre-layout simulations, the output frequency of the VCO is dependent about `90.46 %` linearly on control voltage.
 
 🏷️   During post-layout simulations, the output frequency of the VCO is dependent about `90.28 %` linearly on control voltage.
 
 🏷️   Power consumption of circuit after layout implementation @ `Frequency = 907 MHz` with `50 ohm` load  = `400 uW`
